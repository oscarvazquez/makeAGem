# RubyGems

RubyGems is a package manager for the Ruby programming language that provides a standard format for distributing Ruby programs and libraries (in a self-contained format called a "gem").

You can think of a Ruby Gem as a library or plug-in. Before gems, Ruby plugins required the full code hierarchy to be included directly into your project. Updating a plugin was a painful process, where the updated code would have to be downloaded and extracted atop the previous version in your project. Due to the lack of automation, propensity for mistakes, and the potential for developers to modify plugin code, this is less than ideal.

Today we will be building a gem, but before we do, let's first consider why you might want to do so.

* One of the most obvious reasons relates to code reuse.
* Rails is still an incredibly popular framework so, in order to encourage potential users to consume your service, you might consider releasing a gem that acts as a client for your API, thereby reducing the barrier to entry. 
* If you release a valuable gem, developers will come, and this provides an excellent chance to receive constructive criticism which will help you become a better developer. 
* You might consider releasing a gem to demonstrate your abilities as a developer. Let GitHub and your gem act as a portfolio piece for your coding skills.
* Then most important of all, and why we've included this assignment in this chapter. Ruby developers expect every gem to be heavily tested and not including tests for your gem will be considered a crime. 

In the next couple of sections will discuss how we go about creating our very own gem.
