# Ruby Gem Set Up

I know we're excited to build a gem, so let's get started. We should already have bundler installed, but let's just make sure. Open up your terminal and run the following command.

```terminal
gem install bundler
```
Now that we're sure bundler is installed, it's time to pick the name of our new gem. For this exercise, we will be creating a simple gem called "Stringer." Stringer will have a couple of useful methods that will help us extend the functionality of strings.

The Ruby community consistently produces new gems, and one of the main reasons why is because bundler has made it very easy to set up the infrastructure for a gem. 

If this is the first time you try to create a Ruby Gem, you might be prompted with whether bundler should generate tests for your gem and which testing library you would like to use. Make sure to answer with ***rspec*** and respond with yes for the rest of the questions. 

```terminal
bundle gem stringer --test=rspec
```

After running this command, bundler should have generated the following folder structure for you. 

```terminal
stringer
├── .gitignore
├── .rspec
├── .travis.yml
├── CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
├── Gemfile
├── LICENSE.txt
├── Rakefile
├── README.md
├── stringer.gemspec
├── lib
│   ├── stringer
│   │   └── version.rb
│   └── stringer.rb
├── bin
│   ├── console
│   └── setup
└── spec
    ├── spec_helper.rb
    └── stringer_spec.rb
```

If the command produced an error make sure that you have correctly installed bundler and try again. If the folder structure is very similar but doesn't include any of the RSpec files, we will have to set up RSpec manually. ***If you're not missing the spec folder you can skip the Setting up RSpec section.***

## Updating our gemspec file

Let's first look at the gemspec file (stringer.gemspec in this case). This file provides metadata about the gem, such as the name, description, author, license, and any gem dependencies required for our gem to work.

Before we can move on, some of these fields must be filled out for gem development to begin. Make sure that all of the fields that have the word "TODO" are filled out. You can leave spec.homepage as it is, we will update this field when we push our gem up to GitHub. It's also not mandatory to fill in spec.description. 

Below is an example of a working gemspec.

```ruby
# coding: utf-8
...
  # Removed for brevity, you should leave this code as it is
...
Gem::Specification.new do |spec|
  spec.name          = "stringer"
  spec.version       = Stringer::VERSION
  spec.authors       = ["oscarvazquez"]
  spec.email         = ["ovazquez@codingdojo.com"]

  spec.summary       = "This is simple gem that will help us extend the functionality of strings"
  spec.homepage      = "TODO: we will fill this out later"
  spec.license       = "MIT"

  ... 
      # Removed for brevity, you should leave this code as it is
  ...

  spec.add_development_dependency "bundler", "~> 1.13"
  spec.add_development_dependency "rake", "~> 10.0"
  spec.add_development_dependency "rspec"
end
```

## Setting up RSpec

***You will only have to follow the instructions on this section if you don't already have RSpec set up. If RSpec is already set up move on to the next section.***

To set up your testing environment run the following command

```terminal
rspec --init
```

Running this command will create the spec folder in your current directory, as well as "spec/spec_helper.rb."

Let's cd into our spec folder and create a file named stringer_spec.rb. This file is where all of our tests will go, to start let's just add some dummy tests.

#### stringer/spec/stringer_spec.rb
```ruby
require "spec_helper"

describe Stringer do
  it "has a version number" do 
    expect(Stringer::VERSION).not_to be nil
  end 
  it "does something useful" do 
    expect(false).to eq(true)
  end
end
```

We will have to update our spec_helper to have it import our Stringer Class. Add require "stringer" to the top of our spec_helper file. We will also setup our rake tasks. 

#### stringer/spec/spec_helper.rb
```ruby
require "stringer"
RSpec.configure do |config|
  config.expect_with :rspec do |expectations|
  ...
    # Removed for brevity, you should leave this code as it is
  ...
end
```
Don't worry if you don't understand this part we will talk about rake tasks in a future lesson. For now, just replace everything in Rakefile with the code below. 

#### stringer/Rakefile
```ruby
begin
  require "bundler/gem_tasks"
  require 'rspec/core/rake_task'
  RSpec::Core::RakeTask.new(:spec)

  task :default => :spec
rescue LoadError
  # no rspec available
end
```

Then finally, we will set RSpec as a dependency of our gem. We talk more about adding dependencies in the next section. For now, just include RSpec as a dependency by updating stringer.gemspec located on the root of your gem folder. 

#### stringer/stringer.gemspec
```ruby
  ...
    # Removed for brevity, you should leave this code as it is
  ...
  Gem::Specification.new do |spec|
    ...
      # Removed for brevity, you should leave this code as it is
    ...
    spec.add_development_dependency "bundler", "~> 1.13"
    spec.add_development_dependency "rake", "~> 10.0"
    spec.add_development_dependency "rspec"
  end
```

## Adding dependencies to your gem

For our gem, the only additional dependency that we will be requiring is RSpec. However, you don't have to limit yourself to only using RSpec for future projects. You can add additional dependencies by adding them to our stringer.gemspec file. 

When we add dependencies to our gem we have a couple of choices. We will focus on two of them. We can add a development dependency, and these are dependencies that are only necessary during the development or testing of our gem. A perfect example of this is RSpec. We will use RSpec to test our gem but it's not necessary to execute our code. We can also add a regular dependency, and these are the gems that will be needed come runtime. Below, we've illustrated how to add both. 

```ruby
  spec.add_dependency "some_other_gem"
  spec.add_development_dependency "rspec"
```

## Testing our set up

Alright, we're almost ready to start coding, all that's left to do is make sure we set up our environment correctly. 

Before we do that though let's just quickly reiterate over what we've done so far. 
* We created a new gem template using Bundler. 
* We updated our gemspec file with our information
* We set up our testing environment 
* We added some dependencies to our gem by updating the gemspec file

Now run the following commands from the root of your gem folder to ensure that everything is working flawlessly. For both commands, the tests should run and output "2 examples, 1 failure."

```terminal
bundle exec rspec spec
rake
```

*** If you see the following error: "rspec-core is not part of the bundle. " Make sure you added RSpec to your gemfile. ***

Hopefully, that worked for you. If you had errors while running RSpec, read over the steps again and make sure you put everything where it should go, and you don't have any syntax errors.
